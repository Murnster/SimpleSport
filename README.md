# SimpleSport: Team Management Application

This project was created for my Capstone Project at Acadia University. The goal was to create a web application using React, which I had not used before! The concept behind it was to relate my project to my experience during my school years. As President of the Acadia Men's Rugby Club, I had to management many aspects of the team day-to-day. I wanted to create a simple management app that I could use in lieu of spreadsheet to manage all the data! 

# Instructions

You will need React, Node, Express and MySQL to run the project. The steps below will help users try out the program.

### Download the code
### Navigate to both the client and server directories. Here you will need to run `npm install` to get all dependencies for both.
### In one terminal, navigate to client. Run `npm start` to start the React app. It should run on http://localhost:3000 by default. 
### In another terminal, navigate to server. Run `npm run dev` to start the server. This will run on port 5000.
### Go to database.js and master.sql in server. In MySQL, create a table. Copy all the master.sql commands and run them in your table. Change the database.js file to work with your MySQL.
### Open http://localhost:3000 and check it out! Thanks for reading!
